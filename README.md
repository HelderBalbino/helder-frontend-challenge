# Helder Balbino's Front End Developer Technical Challenge

This project is **todo list application** built with React. It allows users to
manage their tasks by providing **two main lists**: "Todo" for active tasks and
"Complete" for finished ones. Users can **add new tasks**, **add subtasks** to
existing tasks, and **toggle the completion status** of both main tasks and
their subtasks. The application uses **Styled Components for styling** and
**TypeScript for type safety**.
